<title>Part 9: NTLM Relay, Token Impersonation, Pass the Hash, PsExec, and more</title>
</head><body>## Week 8, 9, and 10 (Internal Pentesting):<br/>
<br/>
**Hello Enumeration, My Old Friend** - This lesson will cover post-exploitation enumeration. In other words, weâ€™ve gained access to a single machine in a network, now what are we looking for? The chapter will focus heavily on Active Directory enumeration concepts as that is the likely environment a pentester will encounter in the real world. However, lessons will be provided for non-Active Directory environments as well. Important tools that will be discussed are nbtscan, nslookup, nbtstat, net commands, and more.<br/>
<br/>
**Active Directory Exploitation** - This lesson focuses on the recognition of vulnerabilities and exploitation tactics in an internal Active Directory environment. Attacks that will be introduced include: LLMNR poisoning/hash cracking, SMB hash relaying, pass the hash, token impersonation, kerberoasting, GPP/c-password attacks, and PowerShell attacks. More attacks will likely be added as the lesson is written, but the most common have been provided.<br/>
<br/>
**Exploiting Non-Active Directory Environments** - This lesson will discuss the exploitation of devices in a non-Active Directory environment. Students will learn how to identify critical servers, conduct local password attacks, and learn outside-the-box strategies for attacking. Examples will come from previous penetrati on tests, such as exploiting default credentials on local printers and dumping stored credentials to gain access to critical servers.</body></html>
