<title>Part 6: Enumeration</title>
</head><body>***Enumeration for the win*** - The intent of this lesson is to provide an overview of basic enumeration tactics and then dive deep into specific tools used for common ports found in penetration testing. For example, if we find port 80 open on a scan (HTTP), we will likely want to know what service is running and enumerate that service for potential exploits at a high level. At a deep level, we will want to explore the app with tools such as Nikto, Dirbuster/Dirb, and Burp Suite to really enumerate the app where tools like Nmap and Nessus fail to go deep enough.<br/>
